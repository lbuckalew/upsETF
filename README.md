# upsETF
Visualizing ETF overlap with an upset plot.

GUI by chatgpt to make buttons / options call dummy functions. Financial weighting written by me.

## Test data
Test data with simple allocations are included in the data folder as if it were cashed. The tickers
for the fake ETFs are `ABX`, `ABY`, and `ABZ`.
